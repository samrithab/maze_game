# mazegame
This python based application allows users to play a mini maze game. Users are required to enter directions (N,S,E,W) in order to reach the end of the maze. Along the way there are hidden monsters on the map. When the player enters a "monster occupied zone", they are either required to attack or flee until they reach the end.
